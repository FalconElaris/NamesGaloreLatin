# NamesGaloreLatin -  [![RimWorld 1.3](https://img.shields.io/badge/RimWorld-1.3-green.svg?longCache=true&style=plastic)](http://rimworldgame.com/)

This mod is a port to 1.3 of Gárulf's https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2017130910 NamesGalore Mod. I've reconfigured it to add lists of Latin names. Currently only works for players with `English` set as their language.

## Features
- Adds first names for females and males
- Adds nicknames for males, females, and unisex
- Adds ability to set nickname and solid name probability rate in mod settings

## Acknowledgements

As this is an update of Gárulf's mod for 1.2 that uses the original code by AaronCRobinson which drives the mod, I DO NOT claim ownership of the original code. Source code is included in the mod. Special thanks also to Pardeike's amazing non-destructive patching library, Harmony.
